      <p>Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished on a human timescale, 
        such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, which take 
        millions of years to form and are finite, renewable energy sources are sustainable and have a lower 
        environmental impact. Technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric dams, and biomass 
        energy systems harness these resources to generate electricity, heat, and fuel for various 
        applications. The growing adoption of renewable energy plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse 
        gas emissions, combating climate change, and promoting energy independence.</p>

            of power that produces no pollution or harmful emissions, making it environmentally friendly and 
            helping reduce carbon footprints. Wind energy also reduces dependence on fossil fuels, contributing
             to a greener and more sustainable energy future.
            <br><br>It is a cost-effective energy source in the long term, as once wind turbines are installed, 
            they have relatively low operational and maintenance costs. Furthermore, wind energy can be 
            harnessed in remote locations, providing power to areas that might otherwise be off the grid. 
            The wind energy industry also creates jobs, ranging from turbine manufacturing to installation 
            and maintenance. Finally, wind energy is reliable in areas with strong and consistent winds,

            Hydropower (Hydroelectric Energy)
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>Hydropower energy, also known as hydroelectric power, is the energy produced by harnessing the
             movement of water, typically from rivers or dams. It works by using the force of flowing or 
             falling water to turn turbines, which then generate electricity. Hydropower is a renewable and 
             clean energy source, as it relies on the natural water cycle and does not produce harmful
              emissions. It can provide a consistent and reliable source of energy, especially in areas 
              with abundant water resources. Hydropower plants can vary in size, from small-scale systems 
              to large dams, making it a versatile energy solution. It is widely used to supply electricity

            Geothermal Energy.
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>Geothermal energy is the heat derived from the Earth’s core. It is generated by the natural heat 
            from beneath the Earth's surface, which can be accessed through hot springs, geysers, or deep 
            wells. This heat can be used to produce electricity or provide heating for buildings and 
            industries. Geothermal power plants use steam or hot water from underground reservoirs to drive
             turbines that generate electricity. It is a renewable and sustainable energy source, as the 
             Earth’s internal heat is constantly replenished. Geothermal energy is also considered 
             environmentally friendly because it produces very low levels of greenhouse gases compared to 
             fossil fuels. It can be harnessed consistently and is available 24/7, making it a reliable 
             energy source, especially in regions with high geothermal activity.

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>Tidal energy is a form of renewable energy that harnesses the power of ocean tides to generate
             electricity. It is produced by the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational 
             forces of the moon and the sun. Tidal energy systems use turbines or other mechanisms placed 
             in tidal streams, estuaries, or underwater to capture the kinetic energy from moving water. 
             As the tides move in and out, they turn the turbines, which then generate electricity. Tidal
              energy is highly predictable because tides occur at regular intervals, making it a reliable 
              source of power. It is also environmentally friendly, producing no emissions or pollution.
               However, the development of tidal energy infrastructure can be costly, and it is typically

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>Wave energy is a form of renewable energy that captures the energy produced by ocean waves and 
            converts it into electricity. The movement of waves, caused by wind blowing across the surface 
            of the sea, carries energy that can be harnessed using specialized devices like oscillating water 
            columns, point absorbers, or wave energy converters. These devices are typically placed on the 
            surface of the water or on the seabed, where they use the up and down motion of the waves to
             generate power. Wave energy is highly predictable and reliable, as ocean waves are influenced 
             by consistent wind patterns and gravitational forces. It is considered a clean energy source 
             because it does not produce emissions or pollution. However, wave energy technology is still
