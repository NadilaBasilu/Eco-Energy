            Nuclear energy is a powerful source of electricity that has been utilized for decades. 
            It is often classified as a clean energy due to its low greenhouse gas emissions during 
            operation. Unlike fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide and other pollutants, 
            nuclear power plants generate electricity through nuclear reactions that do not contribute 
            to air pollution. However, the debate around its sustainability and safety continues, 
            making it a topic of global discussion.

      <h3>
        What is Nuclear Enegy and How Does it Work?
      </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>
            Nuclear energy is produced through nuclear fission, a process in which the nucleus of 
            an atom is split into two or more smaller nuclei. This reaction releases a tremendous 
            amount of heat, which is used to produce steam. The steam then drives turbines connected 
            to generators, producing electricity.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>
            The most commonly used fuel in nuclear reactors is uranium-235. When uranium atoms 
            undergo fission, they release energy and neutrons, which, in turn, trigger a chain 
            reaction, sustaining the process. This controlled reaction occurs in a nuclear 
            reactor, which is designed to safely harness the power of fission to generate 
            electricity.

      <h3>
        What Benefits Does Nuclear Energy Brings?
      </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>
            Nuclear energy provides several advantages over other forms of power generation:<br><br>
            <em>Low Carbon Emissions:</em> Unlike coal and natural gas, nuclear power does not emit carbon dioxide during operation, making it a cleaner alternative.<br><br>

            <em>High Energy Output:</em> A small amount of nuclear fuel can generate a massive amount of electricity, making it highly efficient.<br><br>

            <em>Reliability:</em> Nuclear power plants operate continuously, providing a stable energy source that is not dependent on weather conditions, unlike solar or wind energy.<br><br>

            <em>Energy Security:</em> Many countries use nuclear energy to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, increasing their energy independence.<br><br>
        </p>

    <div class="subheading">
        <h3>
          Is Nuclear Energy Clean?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>
            Nuclear energy is considered clean in terms of carbon emissions because it does not produce 
            greenhouse gases while generating electricity. However, there are concerns regarding radioactive 
            waste, which remains hazardous for thousands of years and requires secure storage and disposal.Modern 
            advancements, such as advanced nuclear reactors and thorium-based reactors, aim to improve efficiency 
            and minimize waste, further enhancing nuclear energy's reputation as a clean power source.
        </p>

    <div class="subheading">
        <h3>
          Is Nuclear Renewable Energy?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>
            Nuclear energy is not renewable because it relies on finite resources like uranium and thorium. Unlike 
            solar or wind energy, which can be replenished naturally, uranium deposits are limited. However, breeder 
            reactors and nuclear fusion (still in development) have the potential to extend the availability of 
            nuclear fuel significantly.

          Future Outlook of Nuclear Electricity Generation?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>
            The future of nuclear energy looks promising with technological advancements that aim to make it safer and more sustainable:<br><br>

            <em>Small Modular Reactors (SMRs):</em> These are compact, efficient, and safer than traditional large-scale nuclear plants.<br><br>

            <em>Nuclear Fusion:</em> A potential game-changer, fusion seeks to replicate the sun’s energy process with minimal waste and no risk of meltdown.<br><br>

            <em>Increased Investment in Clean Energy:</em> Governments worldwide are recognizing nuclear energy's role in achieving carbon neutrality.<br><br>

            <em>Waste Management Innovations:</em> Research into new methods of recycling and disposing of nuclear waste continues to improve its environmental footprint.
        </p>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>
            While challenges such as public perception, high initial costs, and nuclear waste disposal remain, nuclear 
            energy is expected to play a critical role in the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.<br><br>

            Nuclear energy stands as a powerful contender in the clean energy debate. While it is not renewable, its 
            low emissions, high efficiency, and technological advancements make it a viable alternative to fossil fuels. 
            As innovation continues, nuclear energy may become an even safer and more sustainable option for powering 
            the world.
