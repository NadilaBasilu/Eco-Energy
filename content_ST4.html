      <p>Alternative energy sources means energy from natural and renewable sources. As the world faces growing
         there will be a shortage of non renewable energy sources in future. That is why we should research and
          improve emerging and alternative energy sources. Examples are, Geothermal Systems(EGS),Ocean Thermal
           Energy Conversation(OTEC),Hydrogen Fuel Cells ,Fusion Energy, Bio Fuels, Tidal and Wave Energy.

        <p>These energy sources aim to provide cleaner and more efficient than traditional coal, oil and natural
             gases. Also most of them release least percentage of Carbon. So they are environmental healthy.
             Not only that they can provide continuously.</br>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>Geothermal systems harness heat energy from beneath earth’s
             surface for various applications including power generation, heating and cooling.
              This energy comes from Earth’s core, where temperature is extremely high. Geothermal 
              power plants use steam or hot water from underground reservoirs to spin turbines and
               generate electricity.

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>Geothermal Systems control heat extraction in various locations. It is a Carbon-free power source. 
        Not only that it produces minimal percentage of green house gases. Geothermal energy is available year 
        around. So it can produce large amount of electricity to fulfill needs. Also they have a long
         operational life, making them a durable investment.

        Disadvantages of  Geothermal Systems
        </h4>
    </div>

     <div class="paragarph">
      <p>Installing geothermal systems ( large scale power plants, ground-source heat pumps) requires high 
        budget. Geothermal drilling and fluid exaction cause to earth quacks. Those systems need significant 
        amount of water for operation , which can be issue in water scarce areas.
        <br><br>Geothermal systems require regular maintenance. So governments should maintain them regularly 
        and improve technology to go deeper levels.

        Ocean Thermal Energy Conversation(OTEC) 
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>Ocean Thermal Energy Conversation is a renewable energy technology that harnesses the temperature 
            difference between warm surface water and cold deep seawater to generate electricity. 
            The temperature difference should be at least 20oC.

        Advantages of  Ocean Thermal Energy Conversation
        </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
      <p>Main advantage of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversation is it produces zero Carbon emissions and also 
        releases less green house gases. OTEC offers high reliability as ocean temperature remains relatively 
        stable year around. OTEC plants have around 30-50 years lifespan. They located offshore. So they have 
        minimal land usage. OTEC systems can be coupled with desalination processes to produce fresh water. 
        This is useful for water scarcity regions. </p>

    <div class="subheading">
      <h4>
        Disadvantages of  Ocean Thermal Energy Conversation
      </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>The initial setups of OTEC is very expensive. OTEC systems need a significant temperature 
            difference (20oC) which is only available in tropical regions. The efficiency of OTEC systems 
            is relatively low. Not only that pumping up cold deep sea water may disturb marine ecosystems 
            and aquatic life. The constant exposure to sea water can lead to corrosion of equipment because 
            water which includes salt increases the speed of corrosion. So it need a regular maintenance and 
            it need a high budget.
            Countries such as Japan, USA  and  several Pacific Nations have explored OTEC as a viable energy 
            solution. If technological advancements improve efficiently and lower costs , OTEC could play a 
            significant role in renewable energy production.

          Fusion Energy

    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>Fusion energy is an advanced and highly anticipated technology. Unlike nuclear fusion, it works 
            by combining light atomic nuclei such as Hydrogen isotops, to release energy. 
        </p>

            Advantages of  Fusion Energy.
        </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>Specially, fusion energy does not produce carbon emissions. It has highest potential efficiency 
            (60%-70%). Unlike solar or wind power this does not depend on external conditions. Fusion provides
             an incredibly reliable and continuous power supply. It does not require large land areas compared 
             to other energy sources. <br>
            The lifespan of fusion power plant is around 40-80 years. International Thermonuclear Experimental
             Reactor (ITER) project in France, are working to make fusion energy reality. If successful, 
             fusion could produce global energy production, safe and clean electricity.

    <div class="subheading">
        <h4>
            Disadvantages of  Fusion Energy.
        </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="paragarph">
        <p>To sustain fusion reactions it needs extremely high temperatures(100 million oC). Making those 
            temperatures in real world is harder than we think. The technological challenges that needs are 
            challenging to achieve. Also the constructions of fusion can have environmental impacts. Building
             and maintaining the infrastructures for fusion reactions is costly. <br>
            Fusion energy technology is still in the experimental stage. Governments and researchers continue 
            fusion energy research with estimate that it may become viable by the 2050 s. While there are 
            challenges it may be a great step of human and it will be replace many of today’s traditional
             energy sources.</p>

        <p>Hydrogen fuel cells need a high cost due to expensive production and storage methods. The lifespan 
            of fuel cell systems is 5-10 years and it is comparatively small. Hydrogen has a low energy 
            density by volume. So it is difficult to store and transport. Hydrogen is highly flammable and 
            to handle it safely requires specialized equipments. There are technical challenges to Hydrogen 
            fuel cells. <br> <br>
            Hydrogen powered vehicles are growing rapidly with companies like Toyota and Hyundai. They have a long life comparatively battery electric vehicles.
