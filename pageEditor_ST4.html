                <h2 id="userprofile">User Profile</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>With the use of the transform property, I created a hover effect on all the cards as well as the images,
                             except for the profile picture. The Choose Profile Picture button opens File Explorer on your computer. 
                             When the text areas in the sections goals, experiences, and contact me are clicked, the border turns green.
                              I used the pseudo-class focus to achieve this. You can also type in these text areas, but they will not 
                              be saved.  By setting the input type to date and month, the volunteering availability text box opens a 
                              calendar. In the Contact Me section, a message pops up when the name and email boxes are not filled 
                              correctly. This was done by changing the input type to text and email, respectively. I used blank to 
                              achieve this. The send button has a hover effect where it changes colour and scales up, but here, the 
                              pseudo-class hover is used instead of the transform property. I used the @media method and Flexbox to 
                              create a responsive webpage.</p> <br>
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>To improve accessibility, I ensured that interactive elements, such as buttons and form fields, are clearly visible 
                            and easy to navigate. I used semantic HTML elements, like  "button", "input", and "textarea", to ensure proper screen
                                 reader support. Additionally, I applied focus states for form fields to help keyboard users clearly see which element 
                                 is active. The "Choose Profile Picture" button is clearly labeled, and the text areas in the "Goals," "Experiences," and 
                                 "Contact Me" sections have proper focus indicators. For error messages in the Contact Me section, I made sure that screen 
                                 readers announce them, ensuring that users with disabilities can easily navigate and interact with the form. The page is 
                                 also designed to be responsive, improving accessibility on different devices.</p>

                <h2 id="sitemap">SiteMap</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>This code creates a responsive Sitemap layout using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) within an HTML structure. 
                            The sitemap is designed with interactive elements that allow users to navigate to different sections of a 
                            website by clicking on them. The visual design is enhanced by CSS styling, which controls the appearance 
                            and interactive behavior of the SVG elements.
                            The SVG element is used to create a scalable map that automatically adjusts to the container's width and 
                            height, ensuring the sitemap remains responsive across different screen sizes. Inside the SVG, various
                             rectangular nodes represent different website sections like the Splash Screen, Home, Content, Table, User
                              Profile, and others. These nodes are defined using the "rect" tag and are linked to specific sections 
                              using the "a" element with the xlink:href attribute, which allows the user to click and navigate to the 
                              relevant pages.
                            Each clickable area has CSS styles that provide visual feedback. When hovered over, the nodes change to 
                            a dark blue color, and the text within them switches to white, creating a smooth transition effect. Grid 
                            lines, drawn using the "line" tag, further organize the layout and separate different parts of the sitemap.
                             At the bottom of the map, team sections link to individual pages, with each section representing a team member’s name.
                              ARIA labels are used for accessibility, ensuring the elements are described for screen readers. The layout has a clean, 
                              modern design with rounded corners, box shadows, and smooth transitions, ensuring it is visually appealing and functional 
                              across all devices.</p> <br>
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>To ensure accessibility in the sitemap, I implemented ARIA labels and roles for all interactive elements within the SVG, such as the 
                            clickable nodes, to provide clear descriptions for screen readers. Each node is linked to a specific section using the "a" element 
                            with the "xlink:href" attribute, and these links are made accessible by using appropriate alt text. The color contrast between the 
                            text and background is optimized for visibility, and hover states are designed to be visually clear, enhancing the navigation experience.
                             Additionally, the layout is responsive, ensuring that the sitemap is easy to use on devices of various screen sizes, and the design remains 
                             accessible to all users, including those with visual or motor impairments.</p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>With the use of aria labels and setting the lang to English visually impaired individuals 
                            can utilize the screen reader on these web pages. The units of measurements used are %, px, vh which are 
                            responsive and supported by other web browsers</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>One of the major challenges I faced during this project was managing my time effectively. I had to prioritize tasks
                         and create a schedule to make sure I could complete the website on time.
                        Ensuring proper layout design, making the site responsive across different devices, 
                        and debugging CSS issues were time-consuming. Achieving a smooth and consistent design while incorporating the right elements for user interaction was another challenge. However, by researching online resources and practicing different techniques, I was able to overcome these obstacles and complete the project.</p>
